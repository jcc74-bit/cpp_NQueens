# cpp_NQueens

NQueens is a puzzle trying to fit 8 queens on a classic 8x8 chess board. The code finds all possible solutions for you. Superqueens is the same thing just that now the queens can also do a knights jump, the minimum board is a 10x10. The code works with different n x n, you just have to change the number within the code.
